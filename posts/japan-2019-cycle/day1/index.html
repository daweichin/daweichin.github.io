From the organised chaos of people moving around the train station to the futuristic vending machines, almost everything about Japan felt different from Melbourne, the city I had grown up in. I can still vividly remember that on my first night in Japan back in 2016 on a post-high school trip with some close friends, as I was walking around the streets near Tsuruhashi station, I knew that one visit to this country wasn’t going to be enough.\nIn 2018, a popular Youtuber who goes by “Abroad in Japan” had uploaded a video about a cycling journey through Japan. At the time, cycling was something I did occassionally, riding to and back from school, or going for the odd ride every now and then. With this in mind, there was only one thing left to do - book some tickets to Japan and experience a cycling journey of our own. The 2018 trip was wild and fun, so much so that in 2019 I found myself heading back to Japan for yet another cycling holiday, which will be covered in this series of blog posts.\nI accidently lost of a lot of media from my phone due to a catastrophic bug with Android when transferring my photos/media to my laptop, but fortunately (unknowningly) Google Photos had been saving some of my images to the cloud during the trip, and my friends also had taken many photos which are used throughout this blog.\nPreparation Having experienced a cycling adventure in Japan the year before, and this trip marking the 4th time for myself visiting Japan, we had a good idea of what to expect and how to plan for the trip.\nWe rented our bikes in advance from Global Wheels, which provided us with road bikes with the option to add panniers which would be how we carried stuff around during the cycle. They also provided suggestions for our route, which was handy, and also suggestions for future routes which I hopefully will find time to come back and do.\nWe had also planned the trip to hopefully get as much “koyo” as possible, however this can be tricky when planning a trip months in advance as the season can change year on year and even by prefecture.\nThe Route The route was designed with help from the team at Global Wheels and from reading similar journeys of those who had travelled around Shikoku (四国). The main part of the ride would be to ride around Shikoku in the clockwise direction, and soak up as much of the anticipated “quieter” southern side of the island, before ending in the famous Shimanami Kaido. It did not dissapoint.\nShikoku is not very high up on the places to visit for most tourists, not being accessible directly by Shinkansen and being inconspicously hidden between Honshu and Kyushu, most might not even know that it exists.\nA summary and link references of each day of the ride is below:\nDay 1 - Osaka to Nara Day 2 - Nara to Wakayama Day 3 - Wakayama to Miyoshi Day 4+5 - Miyoshi to Kochi Day 6 - Kochi to Naka Tosa Day 7 - Naka Tosa to Shimanto Day 8 - Shimanto to Uwajima Day 9 - Uwajima to Matsuyama Day 10 - Matsuyama to Imabari Day 11 - Imabari to Omishima Day 12 - Omishima to Onomichi Day 1 - Warming up We rocked up at the Global Wheels shop in the morning, transferred the stuff from our luggages into the paniers, had a quick bike fit and we were off! The mixtures of nerves and excitement were high in the air, but learning from our mistakes from last year, our first day consisted of a more casual 60KM ride from Osaka to Nara, which was carried out peacefully mostly on bike paths. We followed the Yodogawa river up towards the point where a left would have taken us towards Kyoto, but instead we turned right and headed for Nara. We stopped at an observation tower for lunch which supposedly during the spring season is a popular viewing spot for the sakura trees. Our lunch consisted of Family Mart, which is one of the main convinience store chains in Japan, offering up a wide variety of Bento boxes and sometimes foods that are unique to the local region.\nWith just 200m of elevation for the day, most of it coming in an uphill stretch into Nara, we arrived in Nara well before it was dark and had some time to explore the city that day. We stayed at a hostel right across from Nara JR station, which would be handy as we would be jumping on a train (the only train of our ride) first thing in the morning.\n","wordCount":"806","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2019-11-24T11:30:03Z","dateModified":"2019-11-24T11:30:03Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://daweichin.github.io/posts/japan-2019-cycle/day1/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Dawei's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://daweichin.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://daweichin.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://daweichin.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://daweichin.github.io/archives/ title=archives><span>archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://daweichin.github.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://daweichin.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://daweichin.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Cycling in Japan Day 1 - Osaka to Nara</h1><div class=post-description>The Beginning</div><div class=post-meta>&lt;span title='2019-11-24 11:30:03 +0000 UTC'>November 24, 2019&lt;/span>&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;4 min&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;806 words&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;Me&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/daweichin/daweichin.github.io/tree/master/content/posts/japan-2019-cycle/day1.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#motivation>Motivation</a></li><li><a href=#preparation>Preparation</a></li><li><a href=#the-route>The Route</a></li><li><a href=#day-1---warming-up>Day 1 - Warming up</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><div class=strava-embed-placeholder data-embed-type=activity data-embed-id=2886854364></div><script src=https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js></script><h2 id=motivation>Motivation<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#motivation>#</a></h2><p>Stepping into Japan is like stepping into a whole new world.
