## Day 9 - Uwajima to Matsuyama

The day had finally come - in all our planning of the trip this was the day that was marked as the hardest day of the journey, and for good reason. While the day was not the longest in distance, there was a lot of elevation this day which would test our legs. On top of the elevation, we had a decent amoutn of rain this day (fortunately the only day on the entire trip that rained!) so after arriving in Ozu we were very tempted to hop on the train to Matsuyama, especially since we took a bath in Ozu at a "super onsen" (yes this was the actual name of the place on google maps). Eventually there was some discussion and we continued the ride to Matsuyama, and after what felt like forever we rolled in Matsuyama. This was one of those days where pretty much the entire ride was on the road and pretty busy ones at that, so in terms of riding was not the best.

Matsuyama is home to some famous Onsen, namely the Dogo Onsen which formed a part of the inspiration of the Onsen in Spirited Away.
