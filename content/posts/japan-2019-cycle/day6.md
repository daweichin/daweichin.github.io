## Day 6 - Kochi to Naka Tosa

After a good rest day, we had another relatively relaxing day - a 60km ride from Kochi down to a small sea-side town called Naka Tosa. Rolling out of town the weather was great and we were primed for another good day of riding.

We stopped randomly in a town called Susaki, and coincidently we found a ramen shop that was serving the areas specialty - Nakeyaki Ramen.

There was supposed to be a nice road that took us along the ocean that would lead us into Naka Tosa but unfortunately about halfway in there was a landslide closure and we had to turn around. It was nice while it lasted though.

The accomodation we were staying at for the night is this place and deserves a special mention: https://maps.app.goo.gl/YE6fGVkBA77N1XUX9. If you ever get a chance to visit the area I would highly recommend booking a stay here, as a once in a lifetime experience.
