## Day 2 - Settling in

Day 2 started with a quick visit to nearby Todaiji Temple, a popular tourist attraction which was evident by the many crowds at the temple and surrounding parks. Nara is a popular destination for a day trip from Osaka, given it's close proximity so this was to be expected, but importantly this would be one of the last times on this trip where we would see so many people! From here on out, we were venturing into less travelled territories.

In our planning, we had decided to take a train from Nara to [Hashimoto Station](https://goo.gl/maps/TSTUfAGXR8qiM3ED9) as this worked out better in our overall plans to ride around Shikoku.

> Note that In Japan, to bring a bike on any train the bike must be properly "bagged" before it can be brought on.

Upon arriving at Hashimoto station around midday and after reassembling our bikes, we followed a beautiful bike path that ran alongside the Kinokawa river, which would lead us all the way into Wakayama city. Immediately it felt like we had left the urban jungle that was Osaka/Nara, and while we were distinctly still in Japan the calm and peaceful nature of the bike path made it feel like we were elsewhere. We stopped halfway to grab lunch at a 7-11, and for dinner we tried Wakayama Ramen, a tonkotsu-soy broth.

It was a cruisy 50km today, as tomorrow we have the longest ride of the trip and the earliest start too.
