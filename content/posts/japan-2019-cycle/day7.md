## Day 7 - Naka Tosa to Shimanto

Waking up in the morning to take some drone footage of the sunrise, then going for a morning bath in the Onsen, then going for a breakfast with a view that I probably won't top for the rest of my life, felt like something I would never experience in Australia or possibly anywhere else in the world.

There was a pretty big hill coming out of Naka Tosa, but when you're on a bike hill's are part of what makes cycling interesting. We rolled through country roads, for the first half more inland but after dropping down from the mountains a lot of views of the ocean were on offer before we finally reached Shimanto.
