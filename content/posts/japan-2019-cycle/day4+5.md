## Day 4 - Miyoshi to Kochi

From the middle of the mountains to the largest city in the prefecture, this was one of the prettiest rides I have ever done. We rode mostly on a mix of the road or an isolated trail, and this was not a day to be rushed - the views were taken in full with many stops to take photos. As for food, we stopped unplanned at two different combini as food options were more limited in this region.

## Day 5 - Rest Day in Kochi

Having learnt our lesson the previous year - we planned in a rest stop and it was much appreciated after 4 days of riding in a row. Kochi was a laid back city - very much different from the typical bigger cities of Japan where everyone seems to be in a rush, and we spent most the day eating lots of food (one of the pros of cycling around) and exploring the town.
