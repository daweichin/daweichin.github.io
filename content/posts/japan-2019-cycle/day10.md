## Day 10 - Matsuyama to Imabari

After a hard ride the day before, we had a very lazy start and decided to check out late and roam around town for a bit. We only had an odd 40km to cover this day so we were able to check out the Matsuyama castle grounds which had a great view of the city.

We rode mostly along the cost and some country roads before arriving in Imabari. The year before, myself, Brandon had trained to Imabari from Takamatsu (the original plan was to cycle but we took the train) so we were partially familiar with the city.

We stayed at an Airbnb we found that was hosted by a lovely Japanese couple, (Tsuneto and Akiko Tokunaga), who welcomed us into their home and provided us with a home-cooked dinner and breakfast free of charge. We shared many stories from both ends (luckily the others in my group were quite proficient in Japanese) and was grateful for their warmth and hospitality.
