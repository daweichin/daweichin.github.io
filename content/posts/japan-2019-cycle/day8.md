## Day 7 - Shimanto to Uwajima

One of the more anticipated days, as the Shimanto river was marked as Japan's last untouched river that runs from mountain to sea. Aside from being a beautiful river with crystal clear water, there were many "Sada Chinkabashi" - narrow bridge with no guard railings that we had to cross throughout the day, which is a unique experience for sure and not for the faint hearted. Some of the bridges were busier than others, likely due to them being more accessible by car, but being on a bike meant we passed through many bridges and areas where it was very quiet.

We arrived in another "big" city of the area, (the first since Kochi) - Uwajima and explored including a steep walk up the town's castle before knocking off, as the next day would be the biggest and final challenge of the entire ride.
