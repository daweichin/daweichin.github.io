## Day 3 - A big ride

I can probably count the number of times I have had to wake up earlier than 5:00AM on one hand, and I'm pretty sure each time Cycling has been involved.

Our ride started with a short ride down to the Wakayama ferry terminal, and after purchasing some tickets we were set to take the 5:30AM ferry departing from Wakayama and arriving in Tokushima around two hours later. A quick stop into an udon restaurant for a massive bowl of ramen, and we were off on our way. With over 100KM to go and some hills towards the end of the ride, we wanted to make sure we would reach our accomodation before it started to get dark - which, in Japan at this time of year was pretty early at around 5PM.

Once again, we somehow found our way out of town, and once out of town we were able to follow the Yoshino River for most of the ride. Cycling up on an elevated riverbank, we were treated to sweeping views of the countryside.

We stopped halfway to explore a traditional Edo period town - Udatsu. The town was small, but extremely picturesque. You could probably find similar styled architecture all across Japan, but one of the things that stood out to me was that it seemed like we were the only tourists there.

After Udatsu, we started heading towards Miyoshi, where we would be staying in another hostel. Up until now we hadn't really faced any hills, but entering the mountainous region of Shikoku it was inevitable. This was also one of the first main parts we had to ride on the road, but fortunately in Japan the drivers are generally very safe, often passing by overtaking with a whole other lane, which is in stark contrast to some of the near misses I have had in Melbourne. As we neared the accomodation for the day, the first signs of autumn colors started showing up, in the form of many trees which decorated the mountainsides of the ravines that we were passing through.
