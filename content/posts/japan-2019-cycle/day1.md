## Motivation

Stepping into Japan is like stepping into a whole new world. From the organised chaos of people moving around the train station to the futuristic vending machines, almost everything about Japan felt different from at least, Melbourne, the city I had grown up in. I can still vividly remember that on my first night in Japan back in 2016, as I was walking the backstreets of Tsuruhashi with my close friends, I knew I was coming back for another trip even before the first one had started.

In 2018, a popular Youtuber who goes by "Abroad in Japan" had uploaded a video about a cycling journey through Japan. At the time, cycling was something I had did riding to and back from school occassionally, or going for the odd ride every now and then, but nothing taken seriously. With this in mind, there was only one thing left to do - book some tickets to Japan and experience a cycling journey of our own. The 2018 trip was wild and fun, so much so that in 2019 I found myself heading back to Japan for yet another cycling holiday, which will be covered in this series of blog posts.

## Preparation

Having experienced a similar cycling adventure in Japan the year before, Brandon and myself had a good idea of what to expect and how to plan for the trip. Logistically, Japan is probably one of the best countries you can cycle in, with many "combinis" acting as a safe backup for food and hydration even in rural areas. The drivers are extremely safe, road quality amazing and 

We rented our bikes in advance from [Global Wheels](https://roadbikerentaljapan.com/), which provided us with solid road bikes with the option to add panniers which would be how we carried stuff around during the cycle. They also provided suggestions and help for our route, which was handy, and also suggestions for future routes which I hopefully will find time to come back and do.

We had also planned the trip to hopefully get as much "koyo" as possible, however this can be tricky when planning a trip months in advance as the season can change year on year and even by prefecture.

## Day 1 - Osaka to Nara

We rocked up at the Global Wheels shop in the morning, transferred the stuff we were bringing into the paniers, had a quick bike fit and we were off! The mixtures of nerves and excitement were high in the air, but learning from our mistakes from last year our first day consisted of a more casual 60KM ride, from Osaka to Nara, which was carried out peacefully mostly on bike paths. We followed the Yodogawa river up towards the point where a left would have taken us towards Kyoto, but instead we turned right and headed for Nara. We stopped at an observation tower for lunch which supposedly during the spring season is a popular viewing spot for the sakura trees.

With just 200m of elevation for the day, most of it coming in an uphill stretch into Nara, we arrived in Nara well before it was dark and had some time to explore the city that day. We stayed at a hostel right across from Nara JR station, which would be handy as we would be jumping on a train (the only train of our ride) first thing in the morning.
