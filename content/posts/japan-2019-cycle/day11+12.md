## Day 11 - Imabari to Omishima

The famous Shimanami Kaido which runs between the mainland and Shikoku was the final stretch of our 2 week trip. Almost no traffic, lots of cycling specific paths and infrastructure and breathtaking views makes this a cycling paradise - somewhere you can fully take in and enjoy the simplicity of riding a bike.

The final leg would take us back to Omishima, where we would hop onto the Shinkansen and head back to Osaka where we started.

## Final Thoughts

My final thoughts of this trip, reminiscing of pedaling through the beautiful Japanese countryside and mountains and seasides, is that there is no quite place like Japan and that exploring a country by bike makes you appreciate things that you wouldn't see. While we could have covered the same distance in a car in a much shorter time, it's the sense of adventure being on a bike and at times challenge that leaves me fulfilled and craving another trip like this once more.
